# Diagnostics Hub

The diagnostics hub surfaces operational information for administrators. It
covers mail transport details, recent mail failures with retry, cron event
telemetry, export job status, retention sweeps, and basic environment checks.

## SMTP seam

FoodBank Manager does not force a particular mail transport. Administrators may
hook into `phpmailer_init` to configure SMTP servers, authentication, or
character sets. The plugin leaves this hook untouched by default so site owners
can wire external providers safely.

## Retention runner

The Cron Health panel exposes **Run now** and **Dry-run** controls for data
retention. Results list total records affected and anonymised along with error
counts. All actions are protected by nonces and the `fb_manage_diagnostics`
capability.

## Privacy panel
The Diagnostics hub exposes a Privacy panel to preview Subject Access Request data and execute dry-run or real erasure. Actions require a nonce and the `fb_manage_diagnostics` capability.
