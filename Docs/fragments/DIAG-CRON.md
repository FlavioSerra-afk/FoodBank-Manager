# Cron Health

The Diagnostics page includes a Cron Health panel showing all FoodBank Manager cron hooks. Each entry lists the last and next run times and flags overdue events.

The panel provides **Run now** and **Dry-run** controls for retention tasks. Both actions are nonce-protected and output a masked JSON summary of affected rows.
