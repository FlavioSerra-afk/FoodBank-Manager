# Design tokens

The Design & Theme page exposes four tokens used throughout the admin UI:

- `primary_color` — hex colour value.
- `density` — `compact` or `comfortable` spacing.
- `font` — `system`, `inter` or `roboto`.
- `dark_mode` — default mode toggle.

Tokens output to the `.fbm-admin` namespace as CSS variables and can be
previewed live, including a dark-mode switch that does not persist until
settings are saved.
